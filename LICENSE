FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT OF AIFEX SOFTWARE up to version 1.0
Notice
This Agreement is a free software license agreement resulting from a discussion between its authors and economic rights holder to define the principles governing the distribution of the AIFEX software in its versions prior to its version 1.0 and as for the extended rights conferred to the users. This contract is intended to designate the applicable law: French law, to which it complies, both regarding civil liability law and intellectual property law and the protection it offers to the authors and holder of economic rights on a software.

Preamble
This Agreement is a free software license whose purpose is to give users the freedom to modify and reuse the software governed by this license.

In this respect, the user's attention is drawn to the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing and reproducing the software by the user, given its Free Software status, which may make it complex to handle and therefore reserves it for developers or informed professionals with in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore invited to load and test the suitability of the software for their needs under conditions that ensure the security of their systems and/or data and, more generally, to use and operate it under the same security conditions. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and distributed, provided it is not altered, without adding or deleting any clauses.

CONTRAT DE LICENCE DE LOGICIEL LIBRE DU LOGICIEL AIFEX jusqu’à sa version 1.0


Avertissement

Ce contrat est une licence de logiciel libre issue d'une concertation entre ses auteurs et titulaires des droits patrimoniaux pour définir les principes de diffusion du logiciel AIFEX dans ses versions antérieures à sa version 1.0 et quant aux droits étendus conférés aux utilisateurs. Ce contrat vise également la désignation d'un droit applicable : le droit français, auquel il est conforme, tant au regard du droit de la responsabilité civile que du droit de la propriété intellectuelle et de la protection qu'il offre aux auteurs et titulaires des droits patrimoniaux sur un logiciel.

Préambule

Ce contrat est une licence de logiciel libre dont l'objectif est de conférer aux utilisateurs la liberté de modifier et de réutiliser le logiciel régi par cette licence.

L'exercice de cette liberté est assorti d'une obligation de remettre à la disposition de la communauté les modifications apportées au code source du logiciel afin de contribuer à son évolution.

L'accessibilité au code source et les droits de copie, de modification et de redistribution des Contributions Intégrées qui découlent de ce contrat ont pour contrepartie de n'offrir aux utilisateurs qu'une garantie limitée et de ne faire peser sur l'auteur du logiciel, le titulaire des droits patrimoniaux et les concédants successifs qu'une responsabilité restreinte.

A cet égard l'attention de l'utilisateur est attirée sur les risques associés au chargement, à l'utilisation, à la modification et/ou au développement et à la reproduction du logiciel par l'utilisateur étant donné sa spécificité de logiciel libre, qui peut le rendre complexe à manipuler et qui le réserve donc à des développeurs ou des professionnels avertis possédant des connaissances informatiques approfondies. Les utilisateurs sont donc invités à charger et tester l'adéquation du logiciel à leurs besoins dans des conditions permettant d'assurer la sécurité de leurs systèmes et/ou de leurs données et, plus généralement, à l'utiliser et l'exploiter dans les mêmes conditions de sécurité. Ce contrat peut être reproduit et diffusé librement, sous réserve de le conserver en l'état, sans ajout ni suppression de clauses.

Ce contrat est susceptible de s'appliquer à tout logiciel dont le titulaire des droits patrimoniaux décide de soumettre l'exploitation aux dispositions qu'il contient.
