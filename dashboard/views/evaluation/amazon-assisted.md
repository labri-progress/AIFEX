===> **WAIT A FEW SECONDS BEFORE EACH CLICK** <===
===> **FOLLOW THE PINK BALL** <===

Your goal is to make an order by completing the following steps indicated by an animated pink ball. The ball follows your progression, so if you don't see it, maybe you missed a step. You are encouraged to make some other actions between these steps, such as changing the quantities, add multiple product in the basket, removing products from the basket ... But you **MUST** make all the 4 following steps in order indicated by the pink ball.

**Scenario**

The elements with colored border (red, orange, green) indicate what the other testers have done. 
Your goal is to avoid the red and orange borders, as it means that a lot of testers have done this action.
If you don't have the choice, but to click on a red element, it is ok.
