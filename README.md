# AIFEX - Artificial Intelligence For Exploratory Testing

AIFEX makes Exploratory Simpler and efficient.

It starts and trains an AI model that will guide you while your are testing your web site.

## Run the AIFEX server on Development Mode

AIFEX is designed as a docker compose platform. 

To run it, you must install **docker** with **docker-compose**

Then just execute (if you are using Windows, please use bash): 

    ./dev.sh

Then open http://localhost to create a new session.


## Run the AIFEX server on Production Mode

To run it, you must install **docker** with **docker-compose**


Edit **./prod.sh**:
1. replace HOST_ADDR by your server name.

Then just execute (if you are using Windows, please use bash): 

    ./dev.sh

Then open http://localhost to create a new session.

## Look a the source code

AIFEX is composed of two main components:
* An extension for chrome or firefox that records tester's actions and that sends them to the Session and AI components (browser-extension directory).
* A server that manages exploratory testing sessions. The server is composed on several containers:
    * account : this container handles users' accounts.
    * dashboard : a web server that provides HTML pages for starting new exploratory session and looking at some analytics.
    * evaluator : this container helps tester to follow expected behavior when they test
    * initialization : this container creates the anonymous account and adds some websites and sessions to it
    * model : this container manages AI that will guide testers
    * printer : this container prints session into source code to replay them
    * reverseproxy : this container is a reverse proxy (nginx)
    * session : this container manages sessions of exploratory testing
    * test : this container runs tests
    * website : this container manages website configurations


## Citing AIFEX

We are researchers, therefore if you use AIFEX in an academic work we would be really glad if you cite our seminal paper using the following bibtex:
